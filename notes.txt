Combat system:

put yourself in an array when you start attacking
declare combat (alerts the foe)
foe puts themselves in the combat array


every tick, range over the combat array and perform attacks





alternative:

when spawned, start a go routine that is the "brain" of the entity, which continues until they die.
brain decides to attack (or otherwise)
